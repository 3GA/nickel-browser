      (net::ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR)' (issue 37722)
    - Automatic translations and greater control over content for privacy
    - Really, really reload. A normal reload causes the browser to check with
      the server before reusing its cached content.  The server can decide
      whether or not the browser should use its cached content.  A force reload
      causes the browser to ignore its cached content and ask the server for a
      fresh copy of the page. Use Shift+Reload to force a reload.
